ðŸ“Š 1. Feature Importance Bar Chart
What It Explains
This graph shows which features (columns) are most important for predicting the target variable (main_col).
It is generated using a Decision Tree Regressor, which assigns an importance score to each feature.
Higher bars mean those features have a stronger impact on the target variable.
How to Interpret
Features with higher importance should be prioritized for further analysis.
Low-importance features may not significantly affect customer segmentation.
Helps businesses understand which factors drive customer behavior.
Example
If income and spending_score are highly important, then:

Customers with higher income tend to have a specific spending behavior.
Businesses can target ads and promotions based on these factors.
ðŸ“ˆ 2. Customer Segmentation Scatter Plot
What It Explains
This plot visualizes customer clusters formed by KMeans clustering.
Customers are grouped based on their similarities in feature values.
Each colored cluster represents a different customer segment.
How to Interpret
Tightly grouped clusters â†’ Customers with similar behaviors.
Well-separated clusters â†’ Distinct customer groups exist.
Overlapping clusters â†’ Features may not effectively separate customers.
Example
If the clusters are based on income vs. spending score:

One cluster might represent low-income but high-spending customers.
Another cluster might represent high-income but low-spending customers.
Businesses can use this info to tailor marketing campaigns for each group.
